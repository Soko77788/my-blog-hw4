On the blog posts page (page#2) you can use the BACK button to go back and submit more blog posts and on both pages you can use the light/dark theme button to switch between light and dark mode.

You can also view important information being stored in your local Storage if you right click ---> inspect and read the console and application tabs. Light/Dark theme aswell as form submissions will be stored in there.

## What i've learned and obstacles overcome

1. I've learned some information on how localStorage works and how you can store information there and have Javascript deploy interactive events based on whats in there.

2. I learned how to make a basic light/dark mode toggle switch. 

3. I learned how to take info. from local storage and append it into a document. 

4. I learned how to make a first pages inputs be displayed on a 2nd page.

## Obstacles

1. Learning how to get localStorage to actually pick up certain keys and use them to display info on screen.

2. Having light/dark mode remain persistant after page refresh or back button.

3. The hardest part was definitely getting the blog posts to remain on the 2nd page and not reset after you filled out another form.
